## Abstract

The Turing Way is a community-led and open source resource for reproducible, collaborative, and inclusive data science. Co-created by over 500 contributors on GitHub, The Turing Way enables people to collaboratively share their skills and ideas around best practices for machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The Turing Way is built using Jupyter Book 2. Powered by the MyST Document Engine, Jupyter Books are beautiful, interactive documents which promote reproducibility and reusability. They may be compiled from Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown documents, and can be served as websites or exported as static files.

This tutorial is aimed at beginners with Jupyter Book 2. By the end, attendees will have built a working Jupyter Book that they can take away to develop further in their own projects. We will demonstrate powerful features, including executable content, nested tooltips, and cross-book references. The workshop will showcase how communities like The Turing Way use these next-generation capabilities to inspire researchers, educators, and data practitioners to communicate their findings transparently across a global interconnected ecosystem. And to have fun in the process!
